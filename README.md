# Welcome to the 3drobot documentation.
In order to use the 3drobot you will need Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic full instalation.

## Installation guide.
1. Source your terminal.
2. Run in console:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/santiagorg2401/3drobot.git
$ cd 3drobot/
$ catkin_make
```
3. Test installation by running.
```console
$ roslaunch robot_gazebo display_g.launch
```

If Gazebo runs and the 3drobot spawns, then the installation was done succesfully.
